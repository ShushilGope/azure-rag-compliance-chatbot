## üéØ Problem Solved

Compliance officers in the BFSI sector face a significant challenge: manually searching thousands of pages of dense regulatory circulars. This manual process is slow, inefficient, and carries the risk of non-compliance due to human error.

This chatbot solves that problem by providing an intelligent, conversational interface to this private knowledge base. It uses the RAG pattern to ensure that all answers are grounded in the provided documents, delivering trustworthy and cited responses while preventing the AI from hallucinating.
